## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- It was a headache for me since it's my first time to do a mobile first workflow or 2nd time if I remember. So, It was hard to make the header responsible for
  mobile & desktop at the same time. But at the end i managed to do it.
